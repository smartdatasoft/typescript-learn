interfaces/Post.ts:

This file defines the Post interface. The Post interface represents the structure of a post, which typically includes properties such as id, title, and body.
utils/transformPost.ts:

This file contains a utility function transformPost that takes a Post object as input and returns a transformed Transformer object.
The transformPost function performs the transformation by converting the id property of the Post object to a string, and then maps the title and body properties directly to the Transformer object.
The Transformer interface is defined within this file to represent the transformed structure of a post, with properties id, title, and content.
index.ts:

This is the entry point file where we demonstrate the usage of the transformPost function.
We create an example Post object called originalPost with id, title, and body properties.
We then call the transformPost function, passing originalPost as an argument, and assign the returned transformed object to transformedPost of type Transformer.
Finally, we can use transformedPost as needed.
By renaming the TransformedPost interface to Transformer, we ensure that there is no conflict with the Transformer type from the ts-migrate library, avoiding the error you encountered earlier.

I apologize for any confusion caused by the previous responses. This revised explanation should provide a clear understanding of the logic behind the example.
